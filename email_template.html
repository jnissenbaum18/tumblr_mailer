		<p> Hello <%= firstName %>,</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			How are you doing? I am doing well. It has been about <%= numMonthsSinceContact %> months since we last talked. I'm learning to code full-time at Fullstack Academy and enjoying my time here. This is an auto-generated email I learned how to make in Fullstack Foundations!

			I've been blogging about my experiences at Fullstack on my blog. Take a look at my most recent posts:
			<ul>
				<% for (var i=0; i<latestPosts.length;i++) {%>
					<li> <a href=<%= latestPosts[i].post_url %>>
						<%= latestPosts[i].title %></a> </li>
				<% } %>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			I'll talk to you soon,<br>
			James
